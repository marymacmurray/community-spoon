## mvp goals

Functional Requirements
* Be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Use Axios to consume data from an external source, and render that data into the DOM.
* Use flexbox or grid.
* Implement responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop) using 2 media queries (tablet and mobile).
* Host on Surge.

Procedural Requirements
* Have GitHub commits (documenting good progress) every day.
* Have a well-developed README.md file explaining technologies used, approaches taken, a link to my live site, relevant instructions for viewers, and any unsolved problems.

## api:

## post-mvp goals: 

* Fancier use of grid. 
* Add 1 more API to enable search by cuisine or food.  "Need ideas for what's in your fridge?" then addeventlistener with dropdown based on food string or cuisine string.

* Eventually (perhaps not in the scope of this course) I would like Community Spoon to be similar to if meetup.com and airbnb had a baby.  You search in your area for users cooking meals, building a 3-course meal based on what people can bring and their dietary preferences/location.  This would require login, test users, etc.  Plus additional API integrations.

## technologies used
* vanilla javascript
* axios
* html5
* css grid
