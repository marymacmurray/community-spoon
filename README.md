## mvp goals


## API: 

MVP: Write out what your goals are for MVP, including the minimum, need-to-have features of your app.
Post-MVP: Write out what your goals are for post-MVP, including nice-to-have features that you would like to implement once your MVP is complete.
Eventually I would like Community Spoon to be similar to if meetup.com and airbnb had a baby.  You search in your area for users in the app, building a 3-course meal based on what people can bring and their dietary preferences/location.
